# RecyclerViewApp
This app has a RecyclerView with an Adapter.  It is complex, seemingly more complex than the previous "RecyclerViewProject" that I did.  This has a list of items that you can scroll through.  It also allows you to click on any item, and using an Explicit Intent, it can take you to a second Activity where information about the clicked list item is shown in that activity.
